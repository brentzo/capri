# harness

The running system (as opposed to `tools/`, which is KB build tooling). Pure
Python standard library, zero third-party dependencies.

## What's here (M0 substrate, the buildable slice)

The safety-critical logic of HC-SUB-01, as testable code. The sandbox itself
(Firecracker microVMs, the nftables/eBPF no-route gateway, snapshot/restore) is
infrastructure, not in this repo; what lives here is the decision logic the
harness runs on top of it:

- `yamlmini.py` - a small, strict YAML-subset loader (block + flow), so the
  contract parser has no third-party dependency.
- `substrate/contract.py` - parse and validate the engagement contract
  (HC-SUB-01 §4). Fail-closed: `parse()` returns `(engagement, errors)` and
  yields no Engagement on any error, so nothing is provisioned from a bad
  contract. Runnable: `python3 -m harness.substrate.contract <file>`.
- `substrate/scope.py` - `scope_validate(eng, target, port)`, the default-deny
  scope pre-check (§5.3); out_of_scope wins and unpinned hosts are denied
  (anti-TOCTOU, §4.3).
- `substrate/blast.py` - `blast_gate(eng, tier, has_snapshot, technique_id)`,
  the blast-tier gate (§7): tier cap, snapshot-required for tier >= 2, and
  per-technique authorization for tier 3.

## What's here (M1 store, the data backbone)

The evidence/findings/ledger/audit store of HC-DATA-01 and HC-SAFE-01, as a
SQLite realization of the production target (Postgres plus a content-addressed
blob store). The three guarantees
the specs insist on are enforced in the database itself, not only the app:

- `store/schema.sql` - the schema. `finder_not_verifier` is a `finding` CHECK
  constraint; `probe_event`, `finding_status`, and `label` carry append-only
  BEFORE UPDATE/DELETE triggers; `audit_log` rows chain on `prev_hash`.
- `store/db.py` - `connect(path=':memory:')` applies the schema and returns a
  connection; `now()` is the ISO-8601 UTC stored timestamp.
- `store/findings.py` - `insert_lead` then `confirm`/`reject`/`mark_inconclusive`;
  each verdict change appends a `finding_status` row and updates `finding.verdict`
  atomically, and confirming with `verified_by == found_by` is rejected by the DB.
- `store/ledger.py` - the coverage ledger: `mark`, `done`, `summary`, so a
  resumed run skips `(asset, technique_id)` pairs it already processed.
- `store/audit.py` - the tamper-evident audit log: `record` appends a hash-chained
  row; `verify_chain` recomputes the chain and returns the first broken row.

## Run

```sh
make test                                                   # harness + KB tests
python3 tests/test_substrate.py                             # M0 substrate
python3 tests/test_store.py                                 # M1 store invariants
python3 -m harness.substrate.contract harness/substrate/examples/engagement.example.yaml
```

## Not here yet

Provisioning, snapshot/restore, the gateway, the guard-proof self-tests as live
probes, the kill switch, and the agent loop. Those are later milestones (M0 infra,
then M1 harness skeleton); this slice is the policy core they enforce.
