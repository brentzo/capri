# harness

The running system (as opposed to `tools/`, which is KB build tooling). Pure
Python standard library, zero third-party dependencies.

## What's here (M0 substrate, the buildable slice)

The safety-critical logic of HC-SUB-01, as testable code. The sandbox itself
(Firecracker microVMs, the nftables/eBPF no-route gateway, snapshot/restore) is
infrastructure, not in this repo; what lives here is the decision logic the
harness runs on top of it:

- `yamlmini.py` - a small, strict YAML-subset loader (block + flow), so the
  contract parser has no third-party dependency.
- `substrate/contract.py` - parse and validate the engagement contract
  (HC-SUB-01 §4). Fail-closed: `parse()` returns `(engagement, errors)` and
  yields no Engagement on any error, so nothing is provisioned from a bad
  contract. Runnable: `python3 -m harness.substrate.contract <file>`.
- `substrate/scope.py` - `scope_validate(eng, target, port)`, the default-deny
  scope pre-check (§5.3); out_of_scope wins and unpinned hosts are denied
  (anti-TOCTOU, §4.3).
- `substrate/blast.py` - `blast_gate(eng, tier, has_snapshot, technique_id)`,
  the blast-tier gate (§7): tier cap, snapshot-required for tier >= 2, and
  per-technique authorization for tier 3.

## Run

```sh
make test                                                   # harness + KB tests
python3 tests/test_substrate.py                             # just these
python3 -m harness.substrate.contract harness/substrate/examples/engagement.example.yaml
```

## Not here yet

Provisioning, snapshot/restore, the gateway, the guard-proof self-tests as live
probes, the kill switch, and the agent loop. Those are later milestones (M0 infra,
then M1 harness skeleton); this slice is the policy core they enforce.
